# Plover Icons

Workspace to develop Plover's icons

## Licensing

I am doing my best to only use icons that are free for modification and use in a GPL application (namely, [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover)). For this reason I'll be documenting where icon sources came from for traceability purposes.

License for modifications is covered under GPLv2, or any later version.

## Sources

### Plover

The ![Plover Icon](icons/plover.svg)

### Icons8

Some icons were taken direction from the MIT-licensed [icons8/flat-color-icons](https://github.com/icons8/flat-color-icons). [Icons8](https://icons8.com) were very helpful to me and my support request and I recommend looking into their non-free offerings as well. All of the icons I use from them are from the free repository, though.

#### Direct copy (no modification)

- ![search.svg](icons/search.svg)
- ![settings.svg](icons/settings.svg)

#### Modified from base

- ![refresh.svg](icons/refresh.svg) based off of reconnect
- ![pencil.svg](icons/pencil.svg) based off of edit_image
- ![paper_tape.svg](icons/paper_tape.svg) based off of news

- ![delete.svg](icons/delete.svg) extracted from delete_row

## Google Material Design

I've also taken and modified some icons from [google/material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons). They needed to be colored and spruced up but Google provides great variety in their free set.

- ![pin.svg](icons/pin.svg) based off of pin
- ![trash.svg](icons/trash.svg) based off of delete

## Deepin Icon Theme

Finally, there are some GPLv3-licensed icons that provide good variety and detail that I've simplified for Plover. [linuxdeepin/deepin-icon-theme](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-icon-theme)
