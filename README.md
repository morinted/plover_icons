# Plover Icons

Workspace to develop Plover's icons

## Licensing

I am doing my best to only use icons that are free for modification and use in a GPL application (namely, [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover)). For this reason I'll be documenting where icon sources came from for traceability purposes.

License for modifications is covered under GPLv2, or any later version.
